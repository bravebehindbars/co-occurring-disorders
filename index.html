      <h3 class="mt-4">Some Studies</h3>
      <p>Studies found that people with a mental disorder, such as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), may use drugs or alcohol as a form of self-medication. However, although some drugs may temporarily help with some symptoms of mental disorders, they may make the symptoms worse over time.</p>

      <p>Mental health and substance abuse are deeply interconnected. Many individuals who struggle with mental health challenges turn to substances to self-medicate or cope with their emotional pain...</p>

      <h3>Substance use and addiction can contribute to the development of mental illness.</h3>

      <p>Substance use can lead to changes in some of the same brain areas that are disrupted in other mental disorders...</p>
